ALTER TABLE equipment ADD equipmenttypeid NUMBER(18) NULL
;

UPDATE equipment
  SET equipmenttypeid = (SELECT equipmenttypeid FROM equipmenttype WHERE name = 'Lift Truck')

  WHERE INSTR(upper(notes), 'ENGINE') > 0
;
UPDATE equipment
  SET equipmenttypeid = (SELECT equipmenttypeid FROM equipmenttype WHERE name = 'Construction')
  WHERE INSTR(upper(notes), 'HEAVY DUTY') > 0

UPDATE equipment
  SET equipmenttypeid = (SELECT equipmenttypeid FROM equipmenttype WHERE name = 'Other')
  WHERE equipmenttypeid IS NULL
